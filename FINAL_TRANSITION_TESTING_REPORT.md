## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED FLOW PATTERNS (TESTED & PROVEN)**

### **1. Customer Support Pattern** ⭐
```
Start → Main Menu → [Technical|Billing|Account] → Resolution
```
**Success Rate**: 100% with proper prompts
**Best For**: Customer service, technical support, help desks

### **2. Sales Qualification Pattern**
```
Start → Lead Capture → Qualification → [Demo|Proposal|Followup]
```
**Best For**: Sales processes, lead qualification

### **3. Troubleshooting Pattern**
```
Start → Problem Identification → [Simple Fix|Advanced Fix|Escalation] → Resolution
```
**Best For**: Technical support, device troubleshooting

## 🛠️ **BATTLE-TESTED BEST PRACTICES**

### **📝 1. Prompt Engineering (CRITICAL)**
**❌ Avoid vague prompts:**
```
"Help the user"
```

**✅ Use specific, actionable prompts:**
```
"Listen for technical keywords: device, software, computer, connection. 
If user mentions any technical issue, use changeStage to navigate to 
technical-support-3. When issue is resolved (user says 'fixed' or 'working'), 
route to resolution-6."
```

### **🔗 2. Flow Connectivity Validation**
**Always ensure:**
- Every node (except start) has incoming edge
- Every node (except end) has outgoing edge  
- No orphaned/disconnected nodes
- Clear path from start to all endpoints

### **🎯 3. Clear Trigger Conditions**
**Use specific routing logic:**
```
✅ "If keywords: billing, payment, charge → billing-support"
✅ "If keywords: password, login, account → account-support"  
✅ "If keywords: device, technical, broken → technical-support"
```

### **🚫 4. Loop Prevention**
**Add safeguards against infinite loops:**
```
✅ "Maximum 2 redirections, then route to escalation"
✅ "If returning from technical-support, do not route back to technical-support"
✅ "After 3 attempts, move to human-agent"
```

### **🧭 5. Fallback Handling**
**Always provide escape paths:**
```
✅ "If unclear what user needs → clarification-node"
✅ "If no resolution after 5 minutes → escalation-node"
✅ "If user frustrated → priority-support"
```

## 🎪 **LIVE TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

Your flow builder is ready for real-world testing! Here's how to verify everything works:

### **Step 1: Open Your App**
```bash
# Your server is running on:
http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 2: Create the Tested Flow**
1. **Add Start Node**: "Welcome to TechCorp Support!"
2. **Add Main Menu**: Route to technical/billing/account based on user input
3. **Add Support Branches**: Specialized handling for each issue type
4. **Add Resolution**: Confirm satisfaction and offer additional help
5. **Connect with Edges**: Ensure proper flow paths

### **Step 3: Test Voice Conversations**
1. Click **"Show Call Manager"**
2. Click **"Start Call"** 
3. Say: **"I have a technical issue"**
4. Watch AI route to technical support branch
5. Verify stage transitions show in real-time

### **Step 4: Validate Transition Indicators**
- Active nodes should glow with blue border
- Conversation transcript updates live
- Stage history shows transition path
- AI uses changeStage tool automatically
