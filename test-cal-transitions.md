# 📅 Cal Node Transitions - Test Guide

## 🎉 **Feature Complete!**

Cal.com nodes now support full transition management just like workflow nodes! Users can now add, edit, and remove transitions to control the conversation flow after checking availability or booking appointments.

## ✨ **What's New**

### **1. Cal Node Transition UI**
- ✅ **Add Transitions**: Click the "+" button to add new transitions
- ✅ **Edit Transitions**: Click on transition text to edit labels  
- ✅ **Remove Transitions**: Hover and click the trash icon to remove
- ✅ **Visual Output Handles**: Each transition gets its own output handle

### **2. Enhanced Navigation Logic**
- ✅ **Smart Matching**: Navigation logic matches user responses to transition labels
- ✅ **Calendar-Specific Keywords**: Special handling for booking-related responses
- ✅ **Fallback Support**: Falls back to first edge if no transitions match

### **3. Multiple Exit Paths**
- ✅ **Check Availability Node**: Can have transitions like "Book appointment", "Check different dates", "Talk to agent"
- ✅ **Book Appointment Node**: Can have transitions like "Confirm booking", "Cancel booking", "Change details"

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Check Availability with Multiple Transitions**

#### Flow Structure:
```
[Welcome] → [Check Availability] → [Book Appointment]
                    ↓
               [Different Dates]
                    ↓  
               [Contact Agent]
```

#### Test Transitions:
1. **"Book appointment"** - User says "yes, book that time" → Goes to booking node
2. **"Check different dates"** - User says "can you check next week?" → Goes to date picker
3. **"Talk to agent"** - User says "I need to speak to someone" → Goes to agent transfer

### **Scenario 2: Book Appointment with Confirmation**

#### Flow Structure:
```
[Check Availability] → [Book Appointment] → [Booking Confirmed]
                              ↓
                        [Cancel Booking]
                              ↓
                        [Back to Calendar]
```

#### Test Transitions:
1. **"Confirm booking"** - User says "yes, book it" → Goes to confirmation
2. **"Cancel booking"** - User says "actually, no thanks" → Goes to cancellation
3. **"Change details"** - User says "can I book a different time?" → Goes back to calendar

## 🔄 **Expected Navigation Flow**

### **1. Check Availability Node**
```bash
# User Response: "Yes, I'd like to book that 2 PM slot"
# Expected: Matches "Book appointment" transition → Goes to booking node

# User Response: "Can you check next week instead?"  
# Expected: Matches "Check different dates" transition → Goes to date picker

# User Response: "I need to talk to someone"
# Expected: Matches "Talk to agent" transition → Goes to agent transfer
```

### **2. Book Appointment Node**  
```bash
# User Response: "Yes, please book that appointment"
# Expected: Matches "Confirm booking" transition → Goes to confirmation

# User Response: "Actually, I changed my mind"
# Expected: Matches "Cancel booking" transition → Goes to cancellation

# User Response: "Can I book a different time?"
# Expected: Matches "Change details" transition → Goes back to calendar
```

## 🛠 **How to Configure**

### **Step 1: Add Cal Node to Flow**
1. Drag "Check Calendar Availability" or "Book Appointment" from sidebar
2. Connect it to other nodes in your flow
3. Configure Cal.com API credentials

### **Step 2: Add Transitions**
1. Click the **"+"** button in the Transitions section
2. Edit the transition label (e.g., "Book appointment", "Check different dates")
3. Add more transitions as needed
4. Remove unwanted transitions with the trash icon

### **Step 3: Connect to Target Nodes**
1. Create target nodes for each transition
2. Draw edges from each transition handle to the target nodes
3. Save the flow

### **Step 4: Test Navigation**
1. Start a conversation
2. Navigate to the Cal node
3. Use different user responses to test each transition path

## 📋 **Transition Keywords**

### **Check Availability Node**
- **Book Intent**: "book", "schedule", "yes", "confirm", "perfect"
- **Later Intent**: "later", "no", "not now", "different time"
- **Agent Intent**: "agent", "human", "transfer", "speak to someone"

### **Book Appointment Node**
- **Confirm Intent**: "confirm", "yes", "book", "proceed"  
- **Cancel Intent**: "cancel", "no", "not", "different"
- **Change Intent**: "change", "different time", "reschedule"

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **Transition Design**
- Use clear, descriptive labels: "Book this appointment" vs "Book"
- Cover common user intents: booking, canceling, changing, asking questions
- Provide fallback options: "Talk to agent", "Get help"

### **Flow Structure**
- Always provide a path forward after checking availability
- Include confirmation steps before final booking
- Offer ways to modify or cancel selections

### **User Experience**
- Set clear expectations: "After I show availability, let me know which time works"
- Provide confirmation: "Great! I'll book that 2 PM slot for you"
- Handle edge cases: "If none of these times work, I can check other dates"

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Before (No Transitions)**
- ❌ Cal nodes could only go to one next node
- ❌ No way to handle different user responses
- ❌ Linear conversation flow only

### **After (With Transitions)**  
- ✅ Cal nodes support multiple exit paths
- ✅ Smart response matching for different intents
- ✅ Flexible conversation flows
- ✅ Better user experience with more options

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Update Existing Flows**: Add transitions to existing Cal nodes
2. **Test Different Scenarios**: Try various user responses to test matching
3. **Optimize Transitions**: Refine transition labels based on user behavior
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track which transitions are used most often

**🎉 Congratulations!** Cal.com nodes now have the same powerful transition capabilities as workflow nodes, enabling much more sophisticated and user-friendly conversation flows!
